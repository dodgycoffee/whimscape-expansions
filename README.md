# Whimscape x Expansions
A collection of varying mod support for the Whimscape resource pack.

This repo is intended to be an open-source, collaborative collection of varying mod support for Whimscape. Currently it's just me contributing to this, but I welcome and invite any other artists to contribute to this collection

The **primary version supported is 1.20.1** as it is still the most used as far as I can tell. It's possible this will work with **1.20.x - 1.21.x**, but I'll be honest I'm not testing for that and won't be until I start building a new modpack on that version.

## But why?
I got real sick of trying to install a bunch of different resource packs for mod support, some of which overlapping, and making it harder to setup modpacks and blah blah. Some of which are exclusive to either [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) OR [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/), and not on both. Or some updated on one but not the other. So here we are.

## ‚úÖ Current mod support
- Imnis (GUI only, needs backpacks)
- Scout (GUI only, needs bags)
- Numismatic Overhaul (GUI only, needs coins)

## ‚öôÔ∏è In-progress Support
- Accessories + varying slots

## üé® How do I contribute?
I haven't worked that out yet. But I'm thinking there will be 2 ways to do this.

### Option 1
- Fork the repo
- Make your changes
- Make a pull request to merge it in
After a review and any adjustments needed, I'll get it merged in as soon as I'm able.

### Option 2
- Create a github issue on this repo
- Use the label for "Expansion"
- Fill out the rest with info, and upload a zip file or something containing all the textures you're contributing

I'm gonna say it right now, don't steal stuff from other add-ons and pretend it's yours. If I get a request to remove it because of that I'm gonna be real pissed and you'll be barred from contributing in the future. If you get PERMISSION to use it, then by all means submit it as well as the proof of permission and no worries at all.

Contributors are welcome to add support for other MC versions. We should probably setup a branch for specific one's if they tend to be problematic though. Idk I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

### Existing Whimscape Add-ons
This is a list of all the varying expansions I know of (excluding panoramas) with varying levels of activity or support. Ideally I'd love to rope these authors into this project and just unify everything in an easy to manage repo. But if something is not part of this pack, feel free to check the links below and see if that helps.
